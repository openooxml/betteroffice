//! Word-specific measurement rules.
//!
//! ECMA-376 references are to Part 1 (WordprocessingML); element
//! semantics are summarized in `reference/quick-ref/wordprocessingml.md`
//! ("Spacing (w:spacing)" section for line-rule value semantics and the
//! twips/240ths unit table).
//!
//! # 1. Font-unit line height (single spacing) — [`single_line_box`]
//!
//! Word derives the default line height from `OS/2` **usWinAscent +
//! usWinDescent** (the GDI `tmHeight` lineage), *not* from hhea
//! ascender/descender and *not* from sTypo values — which is why
//! [`crate::font_store::FontMetrics`] carries all three families. External
//! leading follows GDI's `tmExternalLeading`:
//!
//! ```text
//! tmExternalLeading = MAX(0, hhea(ascender − descender + lineGap)
//!                            − (usWinAscent + usWinDescent))
//! ```
//!
//! scaled to the requested size, and Word places it *below* the descent
//! (line pitch = ascent + descent + external leading, baseline hugging the
//! top of the pitch). The `w:noLeading` compatibility flag (`w:compat`,
//! ECMA-376 §17.15.3) drops that external leading entirely.
//!
//! # 2. Auto / exact / atLeast spacing — [`apply_spacing_rule`]
//!
//! `w:spacing w:lineRule` (§17.3.1.33):
//!
//! - `auto`: `w:line` is in 240ths of a line (240 = single, 276 = the 1.15
//!   default of recent Word styles, 480 = double). Word scales the *full*
//!   single-spacing pitch — including external leading — by `line/240`.
//!   Ascent and descent stay put; the delta lands in the leading below the
//!   descent, so cursor/selection rects hug the text at the top of the line
//!   box for spacing > single (observable Word behavior). Sub-single values
//!   that undercut ascent+descent shrink ascent/descent proportionally.
//! - `exact`: fixes the line box at the given height regardless of content —
//!   taller glyphs are *clipped* (at render time; measurement never grows
//!   the line). The baseline is placed preserving the content descent from
//!   the bottom of the fixed box, matching Word: shrink eats the ascent
//!   side first.
//! - `atLeast`: a floor — the measured content height wins when larger;
//!   when the floor wins, the extra space is leading below the descent.
//!
//! Both fixed rules interact with inline objects (images taller than an
//! exact box also clip).
//!
//! # 3. Justification — [`line_is_justified`], [`stretch_spaces`]
//!
//! `w:jc w:val="both"` (§17.3.1.13) stretches **space clusters only** —
//! never inter-letter gaps — distributing the line's slack in equal shares
//! per expandable space cluster (`"distribute"` is the East Asian variant
//! that does stretch inter-character; not implemented here). The final line
//! of a paragraph is not justified, but a line ended by a soft return
//! (shift-enter, `w:br`) *is* — unless the `w:doNotExpandShiftReturn`
//! compat flag (§17.15.3) restores the non-stretching behavior. The
//! soft-return test takes precedence over the last-line flag. Space stretch
//! happens at line layout, after shaping: shaped cluster advances stay
//! fixed, only space-cluster advances grow.
//!
//! # 4. Snap-to-grid — **TODO, not implemented**
//!
//! When a section defines a document grid (`w:docGrid`, §17.6.5), line
//! pitch snaps each line's height up to the next grid multiple unless the
//! paragraph/run opts out (`w:snapToGrid` on pPr/rPr, §17.3.1/§17.3.2).
//! Required for CJK document fidelity; the layout input does not carry grid pitch.
//!
//! # 5. Kerning threshold — [`kern_enabled`], [`kern_features`]
//!
//! Word applies pair kerning only when the run's `w:kern` half-point
//! threshold (rPr, §17.3.2) is nonzero and the font size is at or above it.
//! [`crate::shape`] applies default OpenType features (which include GPOS
//! pair kerning via the `kern` feature) unconditionally; callers gate it
//! per run by passing [`kern_features`]`(kern_enabled(..))` as the feature
//! list. rustybuzz honors `kern=0` for GPOS-carried kerning (proven against
//! the Liberation Sans fixture in `tests/ooxml_text.rs`), so no shaping-side
//! switch is needed.
//!
//! # 6. Compatibility flags from `settings.xml` — [`CompatFlags`]
//!
//! `w:compat` / `w:compatSetting` (§17.15.3) select metric eras. The flags
//! consumed by rules 1 and 3 (`w:noLeading`, `w:doNotExpandShiftReturn`)
//! are carried by [`CompatFlags`]; they arrive parsed from `settings.xml`
//! on the host side and are threaded into every rule as inputs, not
//! globals. Still to come as the rules that consume them land:
//! `compatibilityMode` (12/14/15), `w:useWord97LineBreakRules` (legacy
//! kinsoku line breaking, layered over [`crate::line_break`]), and
//! `w:balanceSingleByteDoubleByteWidth`.
