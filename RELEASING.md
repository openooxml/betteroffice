# Releasing

Changesets drive npm and crates.io releases through the same release PR.

## Changesets

Run `bun changeset` and select every affected npm package. Select
`@betteroffice/rust-crates` when a change affects the published Rust API or
implementation. The eight Rust crates version and publish in lockstep,
independently from npm versions.

Merging a changeset opens or updates `chore: release`. Merging that release PR
publishes every unpublished npm and Cargo version. The Cargo publisher checks
crates.io before each upload, so rerunning a partial release resumes safely.

## Initial crates.io release

The first publication requires a crates.io API token because Trusted
Publishing can only be configured after a crate exists.

1. Create a short-lived crates.io token authorized to publish new crates.
2. Add it to the repository as `CRATES_IO_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` before merging the
   initial release PR.
3. Merge the release PR and confirm all eight crates were published.
4. Add a GitHub Trusted Publisher to each crate with owner `openooxml`,
   repository `betteroffice`, and workflow `release.yml`.
5. Remove the GitHub secret and revoke the bootstrap token.

Subsequent releases use `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action` and GitHub OIDC to
obtain a short-lived crates.io token.

## Publish order

The workflow publishes dependencies before consumers:

```text
betteroffice-opc, betteroffice-xlsx-model
betteroffice-xlsx-parse, betteroffice-xlsx-calc, betteroffice-xlsx-render
betteroffice-xlsx-ops, betteroffice-xlsx-raster
betteroffice-xlsx
```

Cargo versions and internal registry requirements live in the root
`Cargo.toml`. `scripts/version-packages.mjs` synchronizes them with the private
Changesets marker in `crates/package.json`.
