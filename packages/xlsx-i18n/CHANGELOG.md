## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- c6ad184: Add a Google Sheets-style toolbar to the XLSX editor backed by new engine
  APIs for range styling, number formats, selection-format aggregation, format
  painting, merge queries, and history state. Formatting is fully collaborative
  through a content-addressed style catalog (collaboration schema v3; v2 state
  does not migrate). Merging replaces intersecting ranges like Excel, parsing
  repairs overlapping merges in third-party files, and display-list font fields
  now serialize correctly so styled text renders with its real font, size, and
  weight.

## 0.0.6
