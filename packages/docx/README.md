# @betteroffice/docx

Framework-free core for the BetterOffice DOCX editor — the Rust engine (OOXML
parse/serialize, CRDT editing core, text shaping, pagination) compiled to
WebAssembly, plus the display-list, canvas-render, geometry, and accessibility
helpers the adapters build on. Layout never touches the DOM: the engine
measures every line and pages are replayed onto canvas.

```bash
bun add @betteroffice/docx
```

Most apps want the turnkey React component in
[`@betteroffice/docx-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@betteroffice/docx-react).
Reach for this package directly for headless parsing/serialization or when
building a custom adapter.

## Parse and save

A full round trip: open a `.docx`, inspect the typed model, write bytes back.

```ts
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { parseDocx, repackDocx } from '@betteroffice/docx/docx';

const document = await parseDocx(await readFile('contract.docx'));
// document.package: body, styles, numbering, theme, media, headers/footers

const bytes = await repackDocx(document);
await writeFile('contract-out.docx', Buffer.from(bytes));
```

`repackDocx` round-trips against the original buffer so untouched parts are
preserved; use `createDocx` for documents built from scratch.

The engine ships as four wasm assets (container, parser, layout, editing core)
in `dist/generated/`. Browsers fetch them lazily behind the async entry points
(`parseDocx`, save, the layout engine, `createYrsSession`); Node and Bun read
them from disk synchronously on first use. No manual init call is required.

## Collaboration

Connect the editor's Yrs replica to any reliable binary transport:

```ts
import { CollaborationProvider } from '@betteroffice/docx/collaboration';

const provider = new CollaborationProvider(replica, createTransport(), {
  user: { name: "Ada" }, // identity for this peer's remote caret
});
provider.connect();
```

`replica` can be a direct `YrsSession`, the worker-aware adapter returned by
`createWorkerCollaborationReplica`, or the value published by the React
editor's `collaboration.onReplica` callback. The provider speaks Yjs sync-v1;
room routing, authentication, awareness, and reconnection policy remain
transport concerns. Pass a persisted Yrs update as `collaboration.initialUpdate`
when a React editor joins an existing room so it hydrates the shared history
instead of independently importing the same DOCX.

## Development

The generated `.wasm` binaries are intentionally not committed. From the
repository root, install `wasm-pack` 0.15.0 and `binaryen`, then run
`bun run build:docx-wasm`.
Package builds, demo startup, and CI run this step automatically.

### External drop positions

`RenderedDomContext.getPositionAtPoint(clientX, clientY)` queries the same canvas
hit testing used for the caret. Pass viewport coordinates, such as a drop event's
`clientX` and `clientY`. Page scroll and CSS zoom are resolved from the live page
geometry. The query never changes selection or focus.

The result contains `position`, `pageIndex`, and `region`. Header/footer hits also
carry `rId`; footnote/endnote hits carry `noteId`. Positions are local to that
region's display stream. In React, pass the complete result to
`editorRef.displayPositionToYrsLoc(hit)` to resolve its story and paragraph location,
including positions inside tables. Passing a number to that method retains body mapping.

Text runs and their editable content boxes are accepted. Page margins, images,
page gaps, points outside pages, and queries without ready canvas geometry return
`null`. The accessibility mirror backend does not support this query.
