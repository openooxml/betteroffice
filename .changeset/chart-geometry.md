Every OOXML chart family now draws with its own renderer instead of falling through to bars: area, scatter, bubble, radar, stock and surface join bar, line and pie. Stacked and percent-stacked grouping, gap width and overlap, marker symbols, data labels composed from `c:dLbls`, chart text from `c:txPr`, log scales, reversed axes, tick marks, gridlines and secondary value axes are all honoured, and `lumMod`, `lumOff` and `satMod` colour modifiers resolve so themed charts no longer draw oversaturated. Fixes horizontal bar charts, which ignored the zero baseline and drew negative values as nothing.
