PPTX decks now save with edits included, across every surface. The engine diffs the live CRDT state against a freshly seeded copy of the source package and writes back only what changed: untouched slides keep their exact source part bytes, edited slides are patched at the XML level so unmodeled markup — transitions, timing, unknown attributes — survives, and inserted or deleted slides rewrite `presentation.xml`, its relationships, and `[Content_Types].xml`. `Presentation::save()` in `betteroffice-pptx` no longer discards edits, `PresentationHandle.save()` returns the bytes on the npm core, `PptxEditor` gains a save toolbar button, Ctrl/Cmd+S, `onSave` and `fileName` props, and `save` on its `onReady` api, and the Python binding's `save`/`save_path` serialize edited decks instead of raising — `UnsupportedWriteError` is gone.
